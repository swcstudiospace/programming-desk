"""Gate G-4 — contract-first changes.

A breaking change to a contract surface requires a version bump, a migration note, and an
acknowledgement from every consumer listed in ownership.yaml.

Contracts are the only shared surface in a platform-decomposed system. A field rename that takes
thirty seconds in the API repo breaks the iOS client silently, and the break is found weeks later
by a user. Consumer acknowledgement moves that discovery to the pull request.
